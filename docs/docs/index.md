# Welcome to isQ docs

This is a brief introduction to our quantum programming software, isQ, a part of quantum software toolkit of Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Science. The compiler of isQ accepts isQ programs as input, and produces low-level codes written in several kinds of intermediate representations or instruction sets (depending on the specific compiler options). The compilation results could be run on one of several backends: either on real superconducting hardware or on isQ simulators.


As the programming software in a relatively early version, if you find any bugs, please feel free to inform us and we will be very grateful. We also appreciate any kind suggestions. :)


Please head to [Installation](install) to get started.
